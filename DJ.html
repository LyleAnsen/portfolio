				<h1>DJ EMO BOY</h1>
				<div class="dj" style="color:white;"><p>Andrew is known as the Emo Boy of the sound waves. 
				His droll is quite entertaining, actually, 
				and is a very sought after voice for commercial voice-overs. 
				Andrew started off with Warner Brothers as an advertisement foley artist. 
				His opportunity came when one day the voice talent did not appear for an important recording. 
				Andrew auditioned for the part and without batting an eyelash, got the position, replacing the old voice-talent forever.</p>

			<h1>DJ T "TWINKLE"</h1>
				<div class="dj" style="color:white;">The station is popular because of DJ Twinkle. 
				When Twinkle was a younger lad he used to play this game with his friends. 
				The “it” would record an hour’s worth of music and the listeners would try to guest the name of the song. 
				If  someone got the title of any song right, the “it” would have to continue his role. 
				If no one got any of the song titles, a new “it” was pre-selected. 
				So the more obscure the music, the better for the “it”. 
				This is what made DJ Twinkle a phenomenon: that was so well rounded with music.
				The station owners, now including Global Communications, 
				dedicate a slot for him and he can play anything he wants. 
				This is how much trust they have on him.

				<h1>DJ JAY</h1>
				<div class="dj" style="color:white;">Jay comes from generations of voice-talents. 
				His mother, in fact, was the great Vanessa George who was the darling of the silver screen for many years. 
				Being wired to do this, nothing much can stress him out, 
				and which is why he seems calm all the time – thus getting the name Stoic.
				The great thing about his voice is that anyone listening to him also calms down. 
				For this reason, the station managers always put his slot after the traffic news.

				His energetic voice and style will sure perk everyone up. 
				Although his other job is DJing at night in local pubs, 
				he does the early shows on Hip Radio because of his pep.
				When asked how long does he sleep before he goes on air, 
				he says he doesn’t. He says he just reads the latest news online and prepares for his morning show. 
				Of course he says he sleeps the rest of the day until his night shift.

				<div class="dj" style="color:white;">Lilithe is a diehard new age practitioner. 
				You can hear her chimes and tubular bells on the air which she brings with her to the booth every single day 
				(she says they keep her luck.) The outstanding thing about Lilithe is her smooth swan voice. 
				Among a thousand people who auditioned to do the voice of the Japanese animated series Princess Hasegawa, 
				when the producers heard her, she was hired on the spot.
